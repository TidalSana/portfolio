# Josh's Portfolio Site ðŸ’ªðŸ˜˜

Yo! Here's the link to the [portfolio](https://www.joshuasemana.com/)!

## What I used?
I can't even fully remember ðŸ¤” all them, because of some sort of hiatus I had on the project, but these are the main technologies:

- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)
- [ChakraUI](https://chakra-ui.com/)
- [Framer (Motion)](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
